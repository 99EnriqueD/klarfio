# klarflib
Minimalist python library to read and write Klarf files
This module is a pure python module, there are no dependencies.
The idea is that once the data is loaded, you can copy the defects data into a numpy array or a pandas dataframe.

The data of the klarf file is held in a nested dictionnary that follows closely the structure of the klarf itself

I plan on adding a few helper functions to simplify the access to the defect data
