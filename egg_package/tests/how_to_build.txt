go in the egg_package folder
this folder contains at least this stuff :
    egg_package/pyproject.toml
    egg_package/README.md
    egg_package/LICENSE
    egg_package/src
    egg_package/src/klarfio
    egg_package/src/klarfio/klarfio.py
    egg_package/src/klarfio/__init__.py

run :
> python -m build
this will generate a bunch of files and folder (the package it self is in the ./dist folder)

then upload to Pypi repo with :
> python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
> input pypi token (starts with "pypi-" followed by 200 characters)
