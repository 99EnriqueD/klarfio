go in the egg_package folder
this folder contains at least this stuff :
    egg_package/pyproject.toml
    egg_package/README.md
    egg_package/LICENSE
    egg_package/src
    egg_package/src/klarfio
    egg_package/src/klarfio/klarfio.py
    egg_package/src/klarfio/__init__.py

run :
> python -m build
this will generate a bunch of files and folders (the package itself is in the ./dist folder)

make sure the dist folder only contains the latest version otherwise the upload to pypi won't work
(or modify the command to only select the proper version)

then upload to Pypi repo with :
> python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
> input pypi token (starts with "pypi-" followed by 200 characters)
